The SBA Loan Default Prediction project is a machine learning initiative to predict loan defaults using the SBA loan dataset. Leveraging Python, XGBoost, and SHAP, it builds a full training pipeline in Google Colab. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering (e.g., loan ratios, processing times), categorical encoding, and model training with hyperparameter tuning. It evaluates performance with AUCPR and F1 scores, interprets results via SHAP, and saves the model and artifacts. This aids financial institutions in risk assessment and loan management.
